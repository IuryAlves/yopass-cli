# yopass-cli

This is a command-line tool to interact with a (the) [yopass backend](https://github.com/jhaals/yopass) created by [Johan Haals](https://github.com/jhaals).
Even though it is possible to use the service via the [web-frontend](https://yopass.se) I felt the necessity of a cli tool to use this awesome software in our automation projects. 

This cli tool uses [sjcl](https://pypi.org/project/sjcl/) (just like the web-frontend) to perform encryption on the client side thus preventing your secret from ever leaving your os in a _cleartext_ form.

### Installation

yopass-cli requires [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)+ to run.

### Todos
